# Redmine Quickbooks Online

A plugin for Redmine to connect to Quickbooks Online

The goal of this project is to allow Redmine to connect with Quickbooks Online to create `Time Activity Entries` for billable hours loged when an Issue is closed.

#### Disclaimer

Note: Although the core functionality is complete, this project is still under development & the master branch may be unstable. Tags should be stable and are recommended

Use tags Version 1.0.0 & up for Redmine 4+ and Version 0.8.1 for Redine 3 & down

#### Features
* Issues can be assigned to a Customer via drop down in the edit Issue form
  - Once a customer is attached to an Issue, you can attach an Estimate to the issue via a drop down menu
* Employee is assigned to a user via a drop down in the user admistration page.
* IF an Issue has been assined a Customer when an Issue is closed the following will happen:
  - A new Time Activity will be billed agaist the Customer assinged to the issue for each Redmine Time Entery. 
    + Time Entries will be totalled up by Activity name. This will allow billing for diffrent activities without having to create seperate Issues.
    + The Time Activity names are used to dynamically lookup Items in Quickbooks.
    + IF there isn't any Items that match the Activity name it will be skipped, and will not be billed to the Customer 
  - Labor Rates are set by corresponding the Item in Quickbooks
* Customers Can be created via the New Customer Page
  - Customers can be searched by name or phone number
  - Basic information for the Customer can be viewed/edit via the Customer page
* Webhook Support
  - Invoices are automaticly attached to an Issue if a line item has a hashtag number in a Line Item
    + Invoice Custom Fields are matched Issue Custom Fileds and are automaticly updated in Quickbooks. For example, this is usefull for extracting the Mileage In / Out from the Issue and updating the Invoice with the information.
  - Customers are automaticly updated in local database
